You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why (Why?)
Santa Claus is comin' to town, gather 'round
He's making a list
And checking it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Little tin horns, little tin drums
Rudy-toot-toot and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that cuddle and coo
Elephants, boats and kiddy cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
The kids in girls in boy land
Will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toy land town
All around the Christmas tree
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
And he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm a-telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
You mean, the big fat man with the long white beard
He's comin' to town
