You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry
You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why

Look out

He's gonna know whose naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Well, he knows if you were sleepin'
Yeah, he knows if you're awake
And he knows if you've been good or bad
So you better be good for goodness' sake, yeah

You'd better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town

You know, it's supposed to be a secret
But I can't keep it just to myself

You know, if you want everything, you want
